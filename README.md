# ICHIMOKU BACKTESTING PROJECT

This project aims to learn how to apply the Ichimoku trading strategy on cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin or Ethereum) for backtesting technical analysis in order to improve the accuracy of forecast price movements by using Python. The code can also be replicated in order to be used for stocks or forex trading.

__Note: The author is not liable for any concerns regarding the reader's decisions on personal financial strategies. This project was only made to gain new knowledge.__

__Note 2 (February 19th 2021): Someone who invested in BTC or ETH using this analysis could have made some serious gains if he invested and stopped looking. Of course, there is absence of evidence that the opposite could have also happened. So far, Thanksgiving is still not here and the turkey is indeed well alive.__
